# Wrong in Example
* Large star shape does not follow the other two patterns.
- Reason: 
```
   It is not give us a stright line in the second line and third line
   also in the last line and the previous one.
   in the tow star shap it is always add to more 'X' from right and left
   that end it up with star with stright lines   
```

# unclear
* dealing with even height in star shape (how to define the Middle line).
